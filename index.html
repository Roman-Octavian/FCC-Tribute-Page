  <h2>About Socrates:</h2>
  <p>Socrates is a Greek philosopher born in Athens and thought to have lived from 470 BC until 399 BC. He is
    commonly regarded as the main founder of Western Philosophy. While Socrates himself left no written material,
    other philosophers, such as his disciple Plato, have included him in their works.</p>

  <p> Some of Socrates' achievements include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First to introduce morality into Western philosophy.</li>
    <li>Developed the <em>Socratic Method.</em></li>
    <li>Known for his fearlessness, Socrates saved Alcibiades in battle, a well-known Athenian general.</li>
    <li>Became famous amongst his contemporaries, who thought Socrates was the wisest in all of Athens.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Socratic Method consisted of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Irony:</em> Socrates proves someone wrong by making their preconceptions and flawed logic apparent.</li>
    <li><em>Maieutics:</em> Socrates generates what he considered <em>true knowledge</em> by asking astute questions
      to the same person who was proven wrong through <em>irony</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Socrates was eventually detained by the second-generation Sophists, who wrongfully accused him of impiety and of corrupting the minds
    of the young, and sentenced him to death. Although he would've been spared if only he admitted that the Sophists were right,
    Socrates refused to capitulate and drank a fatal mixture containing poisonous hemlock during his incarceration, ending his own life.
